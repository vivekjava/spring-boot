# SpringBoot sample project

## Spring Boot :

 	**Spring Boot** is a **Spring** framework module which provides RAD (Rapid Application Development) feature to the **Spring** framework. It is highly dependent on the starter templates feature which is very powerful and works flawlessly.

â€‹	Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.

## Features : 

- Create stand-alone Spring applications
- Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)
- Provide opinionated 'starter' dependencies to simplify your build configuration
- Automatically configure Spring and 3rd party libraries whenever possible
- Provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration
- Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration

## Important Annotations : 

- @SpringBootApplication
- @RestController
- @Configuration
- @EnableAutoConfiguration
- @RequestMapping(value="/")
- @ResponseBody
- Etc...

## Why we need SpringBoot ?

- In microservice architecture, most of the companies are using Nodejs. Because it is a lightweight, open source, Highly scalable. But **Node Js** is single threaded. So, In that case, you can choose Spring Boot for your microservice.
- Java & Spring framework both are Open-source.
- Java is a multithreaded language.

## How To Run :

1. mvn clean install
2. java -jar **java -jar demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar**
